# Budget Tracker

Personal Budgeting App.

## Running the application on Windows

Use `start_budget_tracker.bat` to launch the app. The script will
automatically create a Python virtual environment if it doesn't exist,
install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and then start the
Flask server and open your browser.
